What is OFDM ?
Answer:-

OFDM is a form of multicarrier modulation. An OFDM signal consists of a number of closely spaced modulated carriers. 
When modulation of any form - voice, data, etc. is applied to a carrier, then sidebands spread out either side. 
It is necessary for a receiver to be able to receive the whole signal to be able to successfully demodulate the data. 
As a result when signals are transmitted close to one another they must be spaced so that the receiver can separate 
them using a filter and there must be a guard band between them. This is not the case with OFDM. Although the sidebands 
from each carrier overlap, they can still be received without the interference that might be expected because they are
orthogonal to each another. This is achieved by having the carrier spacing equal to the reciprocal of the symbol period.
